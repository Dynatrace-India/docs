## Activity: Installing Dynatrace OneAgent

### Accessing Dynatrace Environment
{: .no_toc }
- Access your environment by going to this link, [https://bit.ly/dt-transform](https://bit.ly/dt-transform)
- Login with your credentials
- Go to Dynatrace Hub

### Installing OneAgent
- In Dynatrace Hub, search for OneAgent and click on the card to access OneAgent details page
- Click on Download OneAgent button and it will take you to the screen where you have to choose the OS.
- Go ahead and select Windows.
- Download the installer. There are two options:
	- Click the Download Installer button to download the Windows installer (EXE file) for single-server installation.
	- The OneAgent Windows EXE installer is preconfigured for your environment. If you need to customize it, you can add add the installation parameters at a Windows command line. You can also add the ```--set-param=<value>``` parameters on the Configure OneAgent settings installer screen.
	- For more information, see Customize OneAgent installation on Windows

![OneAgent_Installation_Screen](../../assets/basics_101/oa.png)

- Run the executable file and follow the displayed instructions. If your environment is segmented, for example into development and production, consider organizing your hosts into host groups. To do this, select the Set host group for this host option and provide a name. If the name you enter exists already, the host will be added to the group with this name. If you provide a new name, a new host group will be created. The EXE installer provides a quiet mode. Simply use it with command-line ```--quiet``` parameter.
- Restart all processes that you want to monitor. You‚Äôll be prompted with a list of the processes that need to be restarted. Note that you can restart your processes at any time, even during your organization‚Äôs next planned maintenance period. Though until all processes have been restarted, you‚Äôll only see a limited set of metrics, for example CPU or memory consumption.

### Next steps
{: .no_toc }
- Access the Deployment Status screen.
- Stop and restart easyTravel UI.

<!-- ------------------------ -->
## What happens during the installation of OneAgent?
OneAgent is a set of specialized services that have been configured specifically for your monitoring environment. The role of these services is to monitor various aspects of your hosts, including hardware, operating system, and application processes.

During the installation process, the installer
- Installs executable code and libraries that are used by OneAgent.
- Creates entries in the Windows Registry that start OneAgent as a SYSTEM service. Additionally, the oneagentmon device and WinPcap are installed to allow better integration with the operating system and to facilitate the capture of network statistics.
- Checks the system‚Äôs global proxy settings.
- Checks for a connection to Dynatrace Server or ActiveGate (if you installed ActiveGate and downloaded the OneAgent installer after ActiveGate was connected to Dynatrace).
- ```OneAgent 1.193 and earlier``` Creates its own user (dtuser) to run OneAgent extensions. This user is a member of the Performance Monitoring Users group, and can only log in as a service. The password is randomly generated during installation and stored encrypted. You can't change the password. For security purposes, the dtuser is not allowed to:
	- Access computer from the network.
	- Log in as a batch job.
	- Log in locally.
	- Log in through Remote Desktop Services.
	- The dtuser is required for Dynatrace to operate properly, therefore you must not delete it. If, for some reason, the dtuser was deleted, next update will recreate it.
- ```OneAgent 1.195+``` For fresh OneAgent 1.195+ installations, the default ```LocalSystem account``` is used to run OneAgent extensions. For a summarized view of the changes made to your system by OneAgent installation, see [OneAgent security on Windows](https://www.dynatrace.com/support/help/technology-support/operating-systems/windows/installation/oneagent-security-windows/).
